--> Smart contract are digital contract stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met.

--> Solidity 
           . Solidity is contract-oriented , high level language for implementing smart contract.
           . Solidty is a Language that is used to develop smart contract.
           . It is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine(EVM).
           . Solidity is a curly-bracket language.
           . It is object oriented too.

--> Pragma in Solidity 

           . It is generally the first line of code within an Solidity File.
           . It is a directive that specifies the compiler version to be used for the current Solidity file.
           . Syntax - pragma slidity >= 0.7.0 < 0.9.0;   -- This is for a range of compilers this means that it supports compiler version greater than equal to 0.7.0 and less than 0.9.0
                      we can also specify one particular version syntax pragma solidity 0.8.0;
