--> Variables : 
         
            . They are nothing but the reserve memory locations to store values.
            . This means when you are creating a variable you are reserving some space in the memory.
            . Formal Defination - Variables are used to stopre information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program.
            
            
            
-->    Solidity supports three types of variables.

               . State Variables − Variables whose values are permanently stored in a contract storage.

               . Local Variables − Variables whose values are present till function is executing.

               . Global Variables − Special variables exists in the global namespace used to get information about the blockchain.

--> The three main types of Variables in Solidity are -

            . Boolean - keyword : bool - Value: true/false
            . Integer - keyword : uint - value - signed and unsigned integer of varying sizes
            . String  - keyword : string - value - data values that ar made up of ordered sequence of characters.
