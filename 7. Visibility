-->

   . We can modify the rules of scope in solidity with 4 keywords namely - public , private , internal , external.
   

--> Public 
    
       .  public means that you can access the variable or a function outside the smart contract and inside the smart contract.
   
        
--> Private 
 
      .  you can only call the function inside the contract.

--> External 
 
      . you can only call the function outside the contract and not within the contract in which it is declared as external.

--> Internal 

      .  Call within the contract or other contract that inherits this contract.
