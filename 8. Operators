/*

In any programming language, operators play a vital role i.e.
they create a foundation for the programming. Similarly, the functionality of 
Solidity is also incomplete without the use of operators. Operators allow users to perform 
different operations on operands. Solidity supports the following types of operators based upon their functionality.

Arithmetic Operators
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Bitwise Operators
Assignment operators
Conditional Operator
